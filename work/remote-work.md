# Working Remotely

You may be a remote work veteran or this might be your first remote job. Either way some of the suggestions below will help you ease into working with our team.

## The 3 Rules to success

If you follow these 3 rules, you'll be a better communicator and more productive then 99.99% of people out there. It consists of just following 3 simple rules.

### 1. Every task must have a due date

No matter how big/small, every task must have a due date.

### 2. Once the due date is reached it is _your_ responsibility to get back to the person

Sounds simple enough, but few people do it. Don't wait for the other person to follow up regarding the task, it is assigned to you. It is your responsibility to provide an update. Incase the task is delayed, no worries! Provide a new due date. It is better than staying quiet and hoping the other person forgot.

### 3. If the task is complicated or unknown. Provide a due date by when you will come provide a final due date

In some cases, tasks might be unknown, or complicated. In such situations you can break up the large tasks into smaller tasks, or provide yourself a research task - at the end of which you can provide an updated due date.

## Communication, Communication, Communication

Remote work can seem ideal, no commute and spending more time with family! But it can get difficult at times- the minor interactions that you miss out at the coffee machine, or some confusions that get sorted by just walking over to the desk.

We need to compensate for the lack of those interactions.

## Async where possible, immediate where not

Written communication

## Pick up the phone

All the technologies of Slack, Email, WhatsApp

Don't be afraid to pickup the phone, ask for a huddle

## Inbox Zero

Do you want your inbox to look like this?

Having an unorganized email is a recipe for disaster in remote companies. Missing customer emails, dropping meetings and worse.
