# Working Remotely

You may be a remote work veteran or this might be your first remote job. Either way some of the suggestions below will help you ease into working with our team.

## The 3 Rules to success

If you follow these 3 rules, you'll be a better communicator and more productive then 99.99% of people out there. It consists of just following 3 simple rules.

### 1. Every task must have a due date

No matter how big/small, every task must have a due date.

### 2. Once the due date is reached it is _your_ responsibility to get back to the person

Sounds simple enough, but few people do it. Don't wait for the other person to follow up regarding the task, it is assigned to you. It is your responsibility to provide an update. Incase the task is delayed, no worries! Provide a new due date. It is better than staying quiet and hoping the other person forgot.

### 3. If the task is complicated or unknown. Provide a due date by when you will come provide a final due date

In some cases, tasks might be unknown, or complicated. In such situations you can break up the large tasks into smaller tasks, or provide yourself a research task - at the end of which you can provide an updated due date.

## Communication, Communication, Communication

Remote work can seem ideal, no commute and spending more time with family! But it can get difficult at times- the minor interactions that you miss out at the coffee machine, or some confusions that get sorted by just walking over to the desk.

We need to compensate for the lack of those interactions by overcommunicating.

## Async where possible, immediate where not

Written communication is the cornerstone of the Remote Work. Get in the habit of writing clearl business writing to effectively communicate with teammates and customers

## Pick up the phone

Sometimes if things are urgent pick up the phone and call! With all the tools at our disposal we shouldn't forget the simplest one. Especially if you need something urgently and cannot contact the other person. You will find everyones contact information on slack or whatsapp.

## Inbox Zero

Managing the plethora of online communication mediums is it's own challenge, this comes naturally to some people but can be a struggle for others.

It is still just a skill - once learnt, will serve you well for your entire career.

Having an unorganized email is a recipe for disaster in remote companies. You cannot be an effective leader if you keep missing important emails, calls and meetings.

If you prefer watching a video, here's a link to the Inbox Zero philosophy. You will find many such guides. [Inbox Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLdHnWLbn4A)

The common philosophy of all of them is to have a triage process to handle all tasks.

1. Delete all emails that are spam, trash immediately. Use an unsubscribe tool to flush them for good.
2. Archive emails that you have read and require no further action.
3. Emails that can be responeded to under 2 mins, reply immediately. You can set windows for this through the day.
4. Emails that remain are convereted to tasks that you need to act on
5. Emails that cannot be acted on immediately can be snoozed to be brought back to your inbox on a specific date.
6. Leave no emails in your inbox that serve no purpose.

If you follow these steps your inbox turns into more of a task list, where it is impossible to miss an email or forget to reply. You should have no more than 20-30 active tasks at any time in your inbox.
