# Onsite

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy~!

Twice a year we organize a company *onsite* the goal of which is to meet your teammates in real life, get to know each other and have some fun.

These onsites usually are planned for 3-4 days at resorts/bungalows surrounded by nature. Attendance is mandatory.

Mornings and afternoons are spent with the team, either with long term planning and alignment or team building activities

## Planning

## Preferences

## Responsibilities

There are a set of shared responsibilities that are rotated amongs the team across every onsite. Until we get a fulltime HR :)

### Fun Co-Ordinator

Responsible to plan the games and general entertainmnent over the 3 days. The most high pressure role!

### Travel & Stay Co-ordinator

Co-ordinating logistics and stay with the team. With people coming from dozen different cities via train, bus, flights, ferrys, taxis. This is no easy feat.

### Food & Drinks

If you're a food snob like Prateek, you can take over this role.

## Fun

We are an outdoorsy nature loving bunch, most of our onsites do include a trek or two and visits to the beach.
