# Working Hours

Standard working hours are from **10am to 7pm**. Being a remote company we extend a fair degree of flexibility. You are free to work in the morning or late evenings as per your preference, although it is expected you will be available for calls with customers/team during the above hours.

Communicate with your team and manager to find a routine that works best for you.

We measure output, not working hours.
