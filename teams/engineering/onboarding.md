# Engineer Onboarding

​

## Tools & Apps

In addition to the tools and apps mentioned in the Employee Onboarding, you should get access to the following:
​

### GitHub

All company code is privately available on GitHub under the Bahaal Technologies organization.
​
Best Practices:

* Avoid using credentials or Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for cloning repositories.
* Prefer using SSH keys for authentication. Remember to rotate the keys every 3-6 months.
* Some repositories may have submodules, so don't forget to fetch those as well.
​

### Sentry

Sentry is used for error tracking in almost all of our applications. Familiarize yourself with Sentry and its usage.
​

### Slack Channels

To stay connected and informed, make sure to join the following channels on Slack:

* tech
* sentry-alerts
* caimera-generations
* caimera-product-training

### Cloud Providers

Make sure that you get the developer access on AWS and GCP.
​
Best Practices:

* Avoid using third-party VMs or personal machines for training and inference. Use company-assigned VMs.
* Use SSH keys for cloning company repositories to the VMs.
* Remember to stop the VM after you are done using it to avoid unnecessary costs.
